  The setup window works from the keyboard (#4459). It placed focus nowhere
  when it opened, Enter and Esc did nothing of the window's own, Install
  pressed from the keyboard left focus on a button that had just turned off,
  and when an install stopped nothing moved to Close, so a person on the
  keyboard or a screen reader had to hunt for each step. The cause:
  launcher\app\InstallWindow.cs set focus nowhere and handled no key.

  HOW. Builds launcher\app\Thornswood.csproj as it is (Build-LauncherProject,
  tests\Launcher-Csc.ps1), then launcher\tests\window-starts against that
  Thornswood.dll, and runs it with setup-keys (SetupKeys.cs there): the real
  install window on Avalonia's headless platform, worked by key presses.

    1. As it opens, focus is on its first control, top to bottom.
    2. Esc closes it, as Not now does, with no install.
    3. With every box ticked, Enter on a tick box starts the install, as
       Install does, and focus goes to what the install says, not nowhere.
    4. A planted stop (an install folder holding a NUL, so the install's own
       thread stops at its first step and writes nothing): focus moves to
       Close, and Esc then closes the window.

  No screen is needed, so it runs on Linux and Windows alike.

  Builds under out\harness\ (which git ignores) and deletes its own folder.
